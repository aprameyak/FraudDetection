# JPMorgan Chase Cybersecurity Simulation

This repository contains the code and solutions for tasks completed during the JPMorgan Chase Cybersecurity Simulation from Forage. The simulation involved practical exercises in data analysis and machine learning to solve real-world problems in cybersecurity and data management.

Task 1: Data Visualization with Pandas
Objective: Analyze and visualize transaction data to identify potential trends or anomalies.
Dataset: transactions.csv file containing transactional data.
Tools Used: Python and the pandas library.
Key Operations:
* Data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Generating descriptive statistics.
* Creating visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to represent trends in the dataset.

Task 3: Spam Email Prediction
Objective: Use machine learning techniques to classify emails as spam or not spam.
Dataset: Enron spam dataset, containing labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails.
Tools Used: Python and the scikit-learn library.
Approach:
* Data preprocessing, including tokenization and feature extraction.
* Training and evaluating a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes or logistic regression).
* Measuring model accuracy and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
